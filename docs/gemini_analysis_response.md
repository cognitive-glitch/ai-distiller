# Response to Gemini's PRD Review

## Research Results on WASM Alternative

Based on my research, the WASM approach is indeed feasible:

1. **Tree-sitter to WASM**: Most tree-sitter modules can compile to WASM
2. **Wazero Integration**: Can run WASM without CGO, maintaining pure Go
3. **Proven Approach**: The micro editor project specifically mentions this as viable

However, there are considerations:
- Not ALL tree-sitter parsers may compile to WASM successfully
- Some challenges with standard library headers when compiling to wasm32-unknown-unknown
- Performance comparison needed between CGO and WASM approaches

## Analysis of Gemini's Recommendations

### 1. Intermediate Representation (IR) - STRONGLY AGREE

Your proposal for an IR is architecturally superior:

```go
type DistilledNode interface {
    // Marker interface for our IR nodes
}

type DistilledFile struct {
    Path     string
    Language string
    Children []DistilledNode
}

type DistilledFunction struct {
    Name       string
    Signature  string
    Visibility string
    Body       []DistilledNode
}
```

Benefits:
- Separation of concerns (parsing vs formatting)
- Enables rich output formats
- Simplifies adding new formatters
- Allows for semantic analysis and transformations

### 2. Build Strategy (CGO vs WASM) - REQUIRES POC

Both approaches have merit:

**CGO + Zig CC**
- Pros: Native performance, mature tooling
- Cons: Complex cross-compilation, security concerns

**WASM + Wazero**
- Pros: Pure Go, sandboxed execution, simpler build
- Cons: Potential performance overhead, newer technology

Recommendation: Create TWO PoCs to benchmark both approaches

### 3. Concurrency Model - AGREE WITH ENHANCEMENTS

Your pipeline model is solid. I'd add:
- Backpressure handling with buffered channels
- Graceful shutdown on errors
- Progress reporting for large codebases

### 4. Handling Syntax Errors - CRITICAL ADDITION

Tree-sitter's error recovery is indeed a strength we should leverage:
- Default: Best-effort distillation with warnings
- `--strict` flag: Fail on first error
- Error reporting in structured output formats

### 5. Enhanced Output Formats - EXCELLENT SUGGESTION

The `json-structured` format would be invaluable:
```json
{
  "type": "file",
  "path": "src/main.go",
  "language": "go",
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "name": "main",
      "signature": "func main()",
      "visibility": "public",
      "location": {"line": 10, "column": 1}
    }
  ]
}
```

## Proposed Next Steps

1. **Update PRD** with:
   - IR-based architecture
   - Dual-track PoC plan (CGO vs WASM)
   - Concurrency model details
   - Error handling strategy
   - Enhanced output formats

2. **Create Dual PoCs**:
   - PoC-A: CGO + Zig CC approach
   - PoC-B: WASM + Wazero approach
   - Benchmark both for performance and build complexity

3. **Define IR Schema** in detail before implementation

Should I proceed with updating the PRD with these architectural improvements?
