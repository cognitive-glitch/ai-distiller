## Critical Missing Features (Priority 1)

### 1. Git Mode Support ⚠️ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
```yaml
feature: git_mode
impact: Critical for CI/CD and PR analysis
implementation:
  - Add analyze_git_commits tool
  - Support --git-limit parameter
  - Enable --with-analysis-prompt
  - Parse commit history and diffs
use_cases:
  - PR automated reviews
  - Change impact analysis
  - Release note generation
```

### 2. Granular Filtering Options
```yaml
feature: granular_visibility_and_content_filtering
current_state: Only basic include_private and include_implementation
needed:
  visibility:
    - protected (separate from private)
    - internal (package-private)
  content:
    - docstrings (separate from comments)
    - imports (currently bundled)
    - annotations/decorators
implementation:
  - Mirror CLI's individual flags
  - Maintain backward compatibility
```

### 3. Performance & Resource Controls
```yaml
feature: performance_controls
needed:
  - workers parameter (parallel processing)
  - recursive depth limit
  - timeout per operation
  - memory limits
rationale: Platform integrators need resource management for multi-tenant environments
```

## High-Value MCP-Specific Features (Priority 2)

### 1. Asynchronous Processing & Webhooks
```yaml
feature: async_job_api
endpoints:
  - POST /analyze/async → returns job_id
  - GET /jobs/{job_id}/status
  - Webhook notification on completion
benefits:
  - No timeouts on large repos
  - Better resource utilization
  - Integration with event-driven architectures
```

### 2. Cost Optimization & Budget Controls
```yaml
feature: cost_management
components:
  - Token usage estimation before execution
  - Per-request token limits
  - Daily/monthly budget caps per API key
  - Cost preview endpoint
  - Usage analytics dashboard
critical_for: Preventing runaway LLM costs in automated systems
```

### 3. SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) Generation
```yaml
feature: sbom_as_a_service
formats: CycloneDX, SPDX
capabilities:
  - Auto-generate on every scan
  - Diff between versions
  - Dependency vulnerability mapping
  - License compliance checking
integration: Push to artifact registries
```

### 4. Policy-as-Code Gates
```yaml
feature: policy_engine
languages: OPA/Rego, CUE, Cedar
use_cases:
  - Block GPL in proprietary repos
  - Enforce security standards
  - Compliance automation
  - Custom org policies
```

### 5. PR/MR Context Packs
```yaml
feature: diff_context_packs
output:
  - Changed symbols only
  - Call graph impact
  - Touched configurations
  - Test coverage gaps
benefit: Reduces LLM token usage by 90%+ for PR reviews
```

## Innovative Features (Priority 3)

### 1. Cross-Repository Intelligence
```yaml
feature: org_wide_code_graph
capabilities:
  - Build dependency DAG across all repos
  - Impact analysis for library changes
  - Semantic search across organization
  - Code duplication detection
```

### 2. Vector Embeddings & RAG Support
```yaml
feature: embeddings_service
outputs:
  - Repository-level embeddings
  - File-level embeddings
  - Symbol-level embeddings
integrations: pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus
use_case: Power semantic code search and AI assistants
```

### 3. Incremental Processing
```yaml
feature: incremental_indexing
approach:
  - SHA256 fingerprint per file
  - Cache AST/parsed results
  - Only reprocess changed files
  - Merkle tree for directories
benefit: 10-100x performance on large repos
```

## Quick Wins (1-2 Day Implementation)

### 1. Missing CLI Features in MCP
- **Raw mode**: Process text files without parsing
- **Language override**: Force specific parser
- **Summary types**: Add visual progress indicators
- **Verbose/debug mode**: Troubleshooting support

### 2. Developer Experience
- **Health check endpoints**: /healthz, /readyz
- **Prometheus metrics**: Latency, cache hits, errors
- **OpenAPI/Swagger spec**: Auto-generated API docs
- **Rate limit headers**: X-RateLimit-* standards

### 3. Output Enhancements
- **Streaming responses**: For real-time feedback
- **Compression support**: gzip/brotli for large outputs
- **Custom templates**: Jinja2/Go template support
- **SARIF output**: For security tool integration

## Integration Features

### 1. CI/CD Native Support
```yaml
