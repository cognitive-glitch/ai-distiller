# AI Distiller (aid) MCP Server

## 🎯 The AI Coding Challenge: Understanding Existing Code

When coding with AI (vibe coding), the biggest challenge is **understanding existing code**. AI assistants often write broken code on the first attempt and need multiple iterations to fix it. Why? Because they don't know the actual APIs, data types, and contracts in your codebase.

To save context, AI agents prefer **searching/grepping code** and showing only a few lines around matches. This approach is slow, often misses relevant information, and provides incomplete understanding of code structure and relationships.

**AI Distiller solves this** by extracting complete, precise code structure instantly. Simply tell your AI: *"Distill and study the public interfaces from ./src/components"* - and watch your AI write correct code on the first try!

---

AI Distiller MCP server uses [AI Distiller](https://github.com/janreges/ai-distiller) - Essential code structure extractor that provides LLMs with accurate code signatures, data types, and API contracts from your actual codebase.

> **Note:** This is the very first version of this tool. We would be very grateful for any feedback in the form of a discussion or by creating an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/janreges/ai-distiller/issues). Thank you!

## 📋 Two Main Ways to Use AI Distiller MCP

### 1. **Code Distillation for Better Context**
Extract essential code structure from files/directories to provide AI with accurate API signatures, types, and contracts. This dramatically improves AI's understanding of your codebase and leads to more accurate code generation.

**Example**: *"Distill ./src/components to understand the component APIs before we modify them"*

### 2. **AI-Powered Analysis Actions**
Generate specialized analysis prompts and workflows that guide AI agents through comprehensive code analysis tasks like security audits, refactoring suggestions, or documentation generation.

**Example**: *"Use aid to analyze security vulnerabilities in ./api"* or *"Generate refactoring suggestions for ./legacy"*

**⚠️ IMPORTANT for AI Actions**: AI Distiller **generates analysis prompts with distilled code** - it does NOT perform the actual analysis! The output is a specialized prompt + distilled code that AI agents (like Claude Code, Cursor) or users can execute. For large codebases, you can copy the output to tools like Gemini 2.5 with 1M context window.

**💡 NOTE**: When using AI actions, AI Distiller tries to instruct the AI agent to execute the prompt and analysis immediately after generation. However, the AI agent may or may not follow this instruction automatically. If the analysis doesn't start automatically, simply ask your AI agent to "execute the generated prompt" or "perform the analysis from the aid output".

> This is the first version of this tool and its possibilities of use are very extensive. Apply it to your use-cases, be playful and inventive, and send any bugs or feature requests to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/janreges/ai-distiller/issues). We'll be implementing more useful features in future versions. One of them is the possibility to define your own API token to Gemini or ChatGPT/Claude and let external LLM perform the analysis itself. MCPs have relatively low limits on I/O size and using external LLMs via API would bring additional benefits.

## 🚀 Quick Start with Claude Code

### Option 1: Project-specific installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Install for current project only
claude mcp add aid -- npx -y @janreges/ai-distiller-mcp
```

### Option 2: User-wide installation with manual configuration
```bash
# Install globally for all projects
claude mcp add --scope=user aid -- npx -y @janreges/ai-distiller-mcp
```

**⚠️ Important for user-wide installation:**
You must set `AID_ROOT` environment variable in your Claude Code configuration to point to your current project directory. Without this, the aid tool won't know which directory to analyze.

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aid": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@janreges/ai-distiller-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AID_ROOT": "/absolute/path/to/your/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ✨ Features

### 🔑 How AI Distiller Works

AI Distiller (aid) **DOES NOT perform analysis** - it generates prompts with distilled code for AI agents to use:
1. **aid extracts code structure** (distillation)
2. **Generates specialized AI prompts** for your analysis goal
3. **Outputs prompt + distilled code** to `.aid/` directory or stdout
4. **You or AI agents execute the prompts** to perform actual analysis

**Important**: The output is always a prompt with distilled code - NOT the analysis itself!

### 📋 Typical Workflow

1. **User asks**: "Find bugs in my authentication module with aid"
2. **Claude calls**: `aid_hunt_bugs({ target_path: "src/auth/" })`
3. **aid generates**: Bug-hunting prompt + distilled code → `.aid/bug-hunting.md`
4. **Claude reads**: The generated file and follows the prompt instructions
5. **Result**: Claude performs the actual bug analysis based on the prompt

**Alternative workflow for large codebases**:
- Generate the prompt with aid
- Copy the output to tools like Gemini 2.5 (1M context window)
- Let the external AI perform deep analysis on large codebases

**Note**: AI Distiller only generates prompts - the actual analysis is performed by AI agents!

### 💾 Output Formats

- **Small analyses**: Return directly via stdout
- **Large analyses**: Save to `.aid/` directory as markdown files
- **File naming**: `.aid/ACTION.TIMESTAMP.FOLDER.md`
- **Content**: AI prompt + distilled code in one file
- **Tool usage**: AI agents call these tools via 'aid' command

### 🎯 Specialized AI Analysis Tools (New!)
- **aid_hunt_bugs** - Generates bug-hunting prompt + distilled code (NOT the bugs themselves!)
- **aid_suggest_refactoring** - Creates refactoring prompt + distilled code (NOT the refactoring!)
- **aid_generate_diagram** - Produces diagram generation prompt + distilled code (NOT diagrams!)
- **aid_analyze_security** - Generates security audit prompt + distilled code (NOT the audit!)
- **aid_generate_docs** - Creates documentation prompt + distilled code (NOT the docs!)

### Core Analysis Engine
- **aid_analyze** - Direct access to all AI actions for custom workflows
- Supports 10 different AI analysis types
- Outputs to `.aid/` directory for large analyses

### Code Structure Tools
- **distill_file** - Extract code structure from a single file
- **distill_directory** - Extract structure from entire directories
- Control visibility: public, protected, internal, private
- Control detail: with or without implementation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `AID_ROOT` - **REQUIRED for user-scoped installation**: Root directory for analysis. Without this, the tool cannot determine which project to analyze.

### Working Directory Behavior

⚠️ **Critical Information:**
- **Project-scoped installation** (without `--scope=user`): Automatically uses the current project directory
- **User-scoped installation** (with `--scope=user`): MUST set `AID_ROOT` to your project path

### Claude Desktop Configuration

For user-scoped installations, you MUST configure the project path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aid": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@janreges/ai-distiller-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AID_ROOT": "/absolute/path/to/your/project"  // REQUIRED!
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎛️ Controlling Output Size

### Visibility Levels
Control what code elements are included:
- `include_public: true/false` - Public members (default: true)
- `include_protected: true/false` - Protected members (default: false)
- `include_internal: true/false` - Internal/package-private (default: false)
- `include_private: true/false` - Private members (default: false)

### Implementation Control
- `include_implementation: false` - Only signatures (smallest output)
- `include_implementation: true` - Full method/function bodies (largest output)

### Output Size Examples

| Configuration | Output Size | Use Case |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Public only, no implementation | Smallest | API documentation |
| All visibility, no implementation | Medium | Architecture overview |
| Public + implementation | Large | Detailed API analysis |
| All visibility + implementation | Largest | Deep code analysis |

### Working with Large Codebases

For large projects, aid's output may exceed AI context limits. Strategies:

1. **Target specific directories**:
   ```javascript
   aid_analyze({
     target_path: "src/auth/",  // Just auth module
     ai_action: "prompt-for-bug-hunting"
   })
   ```

2. **Use file patterns**:
   ```javascript
   aid_analyze({
     target_path: "src/",
     include_patterns: "*.py",  // Python files only
     exclude_patterns: "*test*,*mock*"
   })
   ```

3. **Progressive analysis**:
   - Start with structure only (`include_implementation: false`)
   - Then analyze specific modules with full detail

4. **Output to files**:
   - Large analyses go to `.aid/` directory
   - Can be read by AI agents or copied to tools like Gemini (1M context)
